Hangman Online
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for generations. In this online singleplayer version, players have the opportunity to challenge themselves and test their vocabulary skills against the computer.

The game is played by selecting a word or phrase from a pre-determined list, which the player must then guess by suggesting letters one at a time. If the letter is part of the word, it will be revealed in its appropriate position. If the letter is not part of the word, a part of the hangman's body will be drawn on the screen, bringing the player one step closer to losing the game.

The objective of the game is to correctly guess the word or phrase before the hangman is fully drawn, in order to win. The game includes multiple difficulty levels, each with its own set of words and phrases to make it more challenging.

This online singleplayer version of Hangman is perfect for those who want to play and improve their vocabulary skills, without needing another person to play against. It is easy to play and understand, making it a great choice for all ages.
